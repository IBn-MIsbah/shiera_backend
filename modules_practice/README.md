# CommonJS vs ESM

## CommonJS
CommonJS is a way to import modules into our working file using `require` for importing and `module.exports` for exporting. CommonJS is supported by Node.js as the default module system.

## ESM
ECMAScript Module (ESM) is the official standard way of importing modules and is supported by web browsers natively. To use ES modules in Node.js, we need to specify `"type": "module"` in the `package.json` since it is not the default module system in Node.js.

## Usage

### CommonJS
- When working on existing projects that are already using CommonJS.
- When dynamic imports are needed.
- When synchronous loading is needed.

### ESM
- For modern JavaScript development.
- When asynchronous loading is needed.
- For isomorphic code (code that runs both on the server and the client).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### CommonJS

**Advantages:**
- **Familiarity:** It is straightforward and familiar to many Node.js developers.
- **Synchronous Loading:** Modules are loaded synchronously, making it easier to understand the flow of code execution.
- **Dynamic Import:** Allows dynamic imports using `require()`, providing flexibility in how and when modules are loaded.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Performance:** Synchronous loading may result in slow performance, especially in large applications.
- **Limited Standardization:** `require()` is specific to Node.js and is not standardized across other JavaScript environments.

### ESM

**Advantages:**
- **Standardization:** Standardized format supported across both Node.js and browsers.
- **Clear Syntax:** Uses clear `import` and `export` syntax, promoting better code organization.
- **Asynchronous Loading:** Supports asynchronous module loading, improving performance and scalability.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Compatibility:** Not compatible with older versions of Node.js.
- **Import Placement:** `import` statements must be at the top of the code, limiting flexibility for conditional or dynamic imports.
